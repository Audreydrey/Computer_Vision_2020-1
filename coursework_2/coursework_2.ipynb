    "What to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The coursework includes both coding questions and written questions. Please read both the text and code comment in this notebook to get an idea what you are supposed to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, run `jupyter-lab` or `jupyter-notebook` in the terminal to start the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then, complete and run the code to get the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, please export (File | Export Notebook As...) or print (using the print function of your browser) the notebook as a pdf file, which contains your code, results and answers, and upload the pdf file onto Cate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you work on a college computer in the Computer Lab, where Ubuntu 18.04 is installed by default, you can use the following virtual environment for your work, where required Python packages are already installed.\n",

    "`source /vol/bitbucket/wbai/virt/computer_vision_2020/bin/activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you no longer need the virtual environment, you can exit it by running `deactivate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you work on your own laptop using either Anaconda or plain Python, you can install new packages (such as numpy, imageio etc) running `conda install [package_name]` or `pip3 install [package_name]` in the terminal."
